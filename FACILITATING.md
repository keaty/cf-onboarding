### Preparation Suggestions
* Allocate participants for the week. Let them know.
* Designate workstation(s)
* Create and populate Tracker Project(s)
* Create and send invitations for IAAS account(s)
* Provide one "floater" laptop per pair to facilitate independent docs reading

### Communication Suggestions
* **Morning Standup:** to review how the week is going / answer questions.
* **After-lunch pow-wow:** more review and questions (for some groups this is indispensable, for others it's less necessary).
* **+/âˆ†s ("plus deltas"):** An end-of-day email to everyone involved in the week (e.g. onboarders, managers, interested third parties) reviewing what went well and what they would have liked to change about the day. This is an opportunity to reflect and give prompt feedback on how the week is going (it's also something that CF NYC teams do for real).
* **Group Slack:** Start a message thread to share resources and post reminders (a channel is probably overkill).
* **Retro:** What Pivotal experience could be complete without a retro? Order goodies and treat it like a celebration.

### Structure Suggestions
* If you have more than one pair doing this at once (which is a better experience for all involved if you can swing it), try having them rotate after lunch instead of in the morning. This helps with context retention, knowledge sharing, and getting the day started promptly (instead of settling in with a new pair).
* Don't load all modules at once at the beginning of the week. Start with stories to get their environment set up, then add others as-needed in response to Onboarder questions and requests.
* If they find the last hour or so of the day hard to get though (this is a really draining week for Onboarders) encourage them to use it in whichever way will be most productive. This could mean separating from their pair to read docs, if that's what they need.
* Thursday and Friday are good days for the more free-form exploratory modules that they might not have been confident enough to tackle at the beginning of the week.

### Daily Theme Suggestions
* Be conscious of your pair's needs. Support one another. Teach one another.
* When you learn something new, tell your pair. Get in the habit of being honest about ignorance and progress.
* Learn to be comfortable with the idea of breaking something. If you're afraid to break your environment, you'll have a harder time learning and exploring.
* This is your week. Pursue the topics that interest you.
* How will you apply what you've learned this week to the future?
